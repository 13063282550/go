#### Editor's Note: `Take Two`

In the old days of 2013, the OSDSM was born. Then, there were "little to no Data Scientists with 5 years experience, because the job simply did not exist." (_David Hardtke, Nov 2012_) Since then, history has witnessed a few things...

- Data Scientists working across industries and the world
- social media manipulated to disrupt elections
- BLM and #metoo
- machine learning begins falling to engineering
- a pandemic
- climate change disasters becoming very frequent
- remote work becomes normal

In that decade, Data Science has seen growth of jobs, shortfall of goals, success in many industries, abject failure in others, and nefarious use cases. In particular, [adverse consequences and complications of learning from data](http://machinebias.org) appear in too many examples: [elections undermined by psychographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal), [dismal gender (Men=74%) and BIPOC diversity in the AI field](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html), a revived [eugenics](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612275/sociogenomics-is-opening-a-new-door-to-eugenics/), an [explainability crisis](https://hbr.org/2018/07/when-is-it-important-for-an-algorithm-to-explain-itself), [facial recognition](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/04/facial-recognition-technology-identity-tesco-ethical-issues) used to [identify people](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/widm.1278) and systematically [detain them](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-new-internment-camps-xinjiang-uighurs-muslims), ["aggression" detection microphones in schools](https://features.propublica.org/aggression-detector/the-unproven-invasive-surveillance-technology-schools-are-using-to-monitor-students/), and many others. It has never been more clear that **we need to talk about the real world impacts of our work, and consider how our creations are used.** Please join the conversation by spending a day with the prescient novel [Frankenstein](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/24cb1da5-a512-4de1-b24c-639b6452dbec/628778.pdf) and considering what you birth.

Like any tool, data-driven technologies are indifferent to the morality of their ends. Perhaps the greatest risk of all is leaving this tool in the hands of the few expensively-educated people who cannot possibly represent all of us. To balance this, open source movements seek to lower the barriers to education for everyone. Data science and data literacy must be widespread, accessible, and leveraged for building our collective future. More than ever, we need that future to be built by members of society who are diverse and focused on generative, resilient solutions. After all, the things we build are mirrors of ourselves (seriously, read Shelley's Frankenstein).

The OSDSM is built with the belief that **open source education enables the possibility for a diverse, collective, generative future-building.** I hope that you are one of the next Data Scientists to make a difference in the world by helping us all make better decisions with the scientific process and critical thinking. This rewritten curriculum focuses on what is needed to be successful in the entry-level role, but I hope it extends far beyond that.

## The Open Source Data Science Masters

The open-source curriculum for learning to be a Data Scientist. Curriculum resources from both universities and working Data Scientists focuses on foundational theory and applied skills. The OSDSM is collectively-maintained and open to PRs.

The goal of this curriculum is to prepare the student for an entry level Data Scientist role, using open source materials, at no cost. The Masters is self-guided and self-accredited. To better support credibility, the structure now includes a Capstone project intended to demonstrate the student's problem solving approach, skills in execution, and communication. Upon completion, the student can award oneself a [Credential](https://help.accredible.com/add-your-credential-to-linkedin) on LinkedIn from the Open Source Data Science Masters.

This is called a "Masters" because it is primarily geared toward learners with some college-level education in mathematics, programming, economics, or related disciplines. Come as you are!

1. **üìñ The Core** - This is a critical foundation for what is to come; don't skip the foundational lessons.
2. **‚ùÑÔ∏è Specialty** - Choose what is most interesting to you, or most relevant to the work you plan to do.
3. **ü§ù Doing Data Science** - Learn about how doing science with others and for businesses can work.
4. **üßë‚Äçüíª Capstone Project** - Choose a meaningful project or dataset to demonstrate what you've learned.

#### `Take Two` Change Log
1. Restructured ala the [2022 Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18iSlwSG6F57URqIl47KUmEJCtvS_x4Uxp71caY0-wp8/edit#slide=id.g1196d9e5821_0_0).
2. Pruned broken links. It's been a while, and some of these resources have moved -- or worse -- been taken down.
3. Pared down links to a more opinionated list.
4. Theory + Python tools together under each topic. All you need under one roof.
5. Proceeds. [Bookshop.org](http://bookshop.org) links for all books, which supports independent bookshops with commissions. Since the first commits in 2014, I have donated any related commissions to [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/), which was one of the few healthcare providers in my community growing up and is the largest single provider of reproductive health services in the US. Though donations should flow to independent bookshops from now on, my personal commitment to PP remains.
